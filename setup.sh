# DNAtax setup
#==============================================================================#
# Objective: The purpose of this script is to set up the computational         #
#            environment in a reproducibile and robust way. As DNAtax relies   #
#            upon a multitude of software from various authors and channels,   #
#            any discrepancies can lead to software breaking or giving         #
#            conflicting results. This setup.sh script aims to prevent that.   #
